    <h3>Intro</h3>
    <p>Screen.Java is a class that will handle the screen of your game (essentially, it IS the screen of your game). As well as creating your game's screen, this class also has some useful methods that will help with visuals and memory control.</p>
  </div>
  <!-- clear(); -->
  <div id="clear()method">
    <h3>clear();</h3>
    <p>The clear(); method is pretty simple; all it does is clear the screen. This makes sure that the game doesn't overload and crash from rendering too many things at once.</p>
  </div>
  <!-- drawRect(); -->
  <div id="drawrect()method">
    <h3>drawRect();</h3>
    <p> The drawRect(); method draws the border of a rectangle on your screen. This method takes the parameters:</p>
    <ul class="parameterlist">
      <li>int x - x co-ordinate of start</li>
      <li>int y - y co-ordinate of start</li>
      <li>int width - # of pixels wide (x-axis)</li>
      <li>int height - # of pixels tall (y-axis)</li>
      <li>int color - color of the outline (in hexidecimal format)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example: drawRect(0, 0, 10, 20, 0x000000); //makes a rectangle at (0, 0) which is 10 px wide and 20 px tall and is black</p>
  </div>
  <!-- fillRect(); -->
